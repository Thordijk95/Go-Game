# Go Game
Starting point for the Go game

* Usage of Java 21 is required
  * Make sure your IDE uses the correct version and/or set $JAVA_HOME if you use the commandline
* Clone (with Git) or download this project to your PC
* Make a public personal repository on your GitHub account
* Push with Git the initial project and your progress to your personal repository (on master)
* Use meaningful Git commits (and branching) to organize your work (commit early, commit often)
* Import the code style from the src/main/resources directory
* Use Maven to build the project (or use your IDE)
* Run the application using the commandline or IDE: 
  * `mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.nedap.go.Go"`. 
  * In your IDE look for the Go.java
